"Executive Overview"

Two hundred and forty eight mice began time-interval screening with 
antineoplastic medications for squamous cell carcinoma.The trials lasted 45 days, the cutaneous
anomalies were measured in time intervals to identify time-tested reactions to different 
treatment considerations consisting of: 

Capomulin	
Ceftamin	
Infubinol	
Ketapril	
Naftisol	
Placebo	
Propriva	
Ramicane	
Stelasyn	
Zoniferol	


The sample consisted of 51.0% Male mice and 49.0% Female mice.The average age of the sample
was 12.7762085 months, according to PubMed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, 9 mouse days equal to a human year.
The sample discussed assimilates a human age group with 43.20 years of age.
45 days of antineoplastic treatment on a mouse is comparable to 5 human years of treatment.

Focusing on the contrast of Capomulin, Ramincane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, the following 
highlights were derived:


The smallest tumor based on its size was produced from the trial with Ramicane at a volume of 22.05.
Ramicanes average over all the trials was .45mm^3 smaller than the final average volume of all Capomulin
trials.

The final average of tumors for Ramicane was 40.21mm^3, and Capomulin's 40.67mm^3 
On the other hand Ketapril performed the least favorable with the highest tumor volume at 78.56mm^3
30.41mm^3 higher than Capomulin. The average difference between Ketapril and Capomulin was 14.55mm^3, and
the difference between the smallest tumors accounted per Ketapril and capomulin was 21.66mm^3

The distribution of results focused on Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin can be compared 
in pairs as expressed on the box plot. Capomulin, and Ramicane performed similarly with an almost
parallel distribution of results. It is important to acknowledge that an outlier was found with 
the Infubinol trials, a tumor the size of 36.32mm^3 when the remainder of the subjects maintained 
their tumors above 45mm^3 and below 80mm^3.

The graph following Mouse ID l509 concludes that over the course of the trial, the nature of 
the healing process allowed the anomaly to grow consistently for about half the time of the 
trial and the results of capomulin are appreciated on the latter half of the treatment with a decrease 
in size of about 20%.The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume 0.84.
